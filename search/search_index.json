STEPS - STEP 01- Create a conda environment after opening the repository in VSCODE conda create --prefix ./env python = 3 .8.13 -y STEP 02- install the requirements pip install -r requirements.txt STEP 03- initialize the dvc project dvc init It will run for 100 Epochs. You can change this into params.yaml section for the number of records. This repository represents \" MultiVariate Classification \" . With the help of this project we can Classifiy 4 Attributes of An Image . \u23f3 Dataset Download the dataset for custom training https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mV7EP-maKTNu2RNv6wYRnaoON9dOqLNt/view?usp=sharing :desktop_computer: Installation :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements Python 3.8+ Tensorflow 2.9.1 Keras Pandas Numpy Os :gear: Setup Create virtual environment. $ conda create --prefix ./env python = 3 .8.13 -y Activate virtual enviroment. conda activate ./env OR $ source activate ./env Run setup.py $ pip install -e.

We can modify the parameters in the params.yaml file in the root directory of the folder. \ud83c\udfaf Inference demo Testing with Images (Put test inages in anywhere and give the location of this image to img_path parameter inside prediction model function in src/infrence.py file) $ python src/infrence.py In img_path give the path of the image that you want to get prediction. To run Tensorboard tensorboard --logdir ./logs Data Augmentation For Data Augmentation We can use * changes in Angels, Rotation and lighting * Changes in Lighting and direction + Flipping about the vertical axis * Flipping about the horizontal axis and rotating by 90, 180, 270 degress.
