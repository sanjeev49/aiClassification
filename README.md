- This repository represents **" MultiVariate Classification  "**.
- With the help of this project we can Classifiy 4 Attributes of An Image .
  
## üìù Description
- This implemantation is based on official **resnet50** 
- In this project we have used **Pretrained Model** and **tensorboard** for image classification and checking the accuracy of the model.

## ‚è≥ Dataset

## :desktop_computer:	Installation

### :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Tensorflow 2.9.1
* Keras 
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Os 


## :gear: Setup
1. Install Tensorflow :-
```bash
$ pip3 install tensorflow
```
```bash
$ pip3 install pandas

```
```bash
$ pip3 install matplotlib

```

```bash
$ pip3 install -e.

```
## üéØ Inference demo
1. Testing with **Images** ( Put test images in **AlphaPose/examples/demo/** )  :-
```bash
$ python src/infrence.py 

```
In img_path give the path of the image that you want to get prediction.
